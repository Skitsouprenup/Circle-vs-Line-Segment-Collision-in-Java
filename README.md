# Circle-to-Line-Segment-Collision-in-Java
Circle-to-line collision algorithm.

I recommend viewers to watch my to previous videos regarding Lines, Points and circles Collision/Intersection before watching this tutorial.

Point vs Line: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObCgBRSsF0o&t=0s

Line vs Line: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3hYp0639lc&t=0s

Circle vs Circle and Circle vs Point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnQp1aKVExc&t=0s

This project demonstrates a collision between a circle and a line. This project is explained in this tutorial

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain circle-to-line collision algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
